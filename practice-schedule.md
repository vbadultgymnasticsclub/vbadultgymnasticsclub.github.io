# Practice Schedule

All of our practices are open gym format which means we do not have a coach and the atmosphere is quite relaxed and open. Many of us were coaches in the past and/or gymnasts in the past though so we are always happy to help each other out with tips. 

The Hurricane Gymnastics facility in Chesapeake, VA has been kind enough to host our team during open gym sessions to accomodate our team practices. Hurricane Gymnastics offers open gyms three times a week, and the Sunday practice is exclusively the Virginia Beach Adult Gymnastics Club's adult only (18+) practice/open gym. Wednesdays and Fridays are generic open gym sessions for those of all ages, which means if you choose to come on one of those days, there may be children and high schoolers practicing as well. During our adult only Sunday (and sometimes Wednesday) practices, we begin by stretching and warming up together first. Please see the below practice schedule for the 2023-2024 season:

Wednesdays
9-11pm
Open to public, all ages, no VBAGC membership required to attend, no led stretch/warmup
Typically not too crowded

Fridays
9-11pm
Open to public, all ages, no VBAGC membership required to attend, no led stretch/warmup
Typicall most crowded

Sundays
7:00-9:00pm
18+ only, VBAGC paid members only
Not crowded

Location:
Hurricane Gymnastics
409 Network Station, Chesapeake, VA 23320

Wednesdays tend to be calmer and less crowded, as most of the kids are not coming mid-week, and of course Sundays as well with adults only one. Fridays tend to be busier. Please disregard the fact that Hurricane Gymnastics may say "closed" on Google when searching for hours of operation during these windows. For announcements regarding closures due to weather, holidays, or other reasons, we wil post these on the public Instagram page. Other team discussions such as meet logistics and other relevant things can be found in the team GroupMe chat. You can join here

We are excited to hear from you! All ages, genders, and skill levels are welcome. This is a very casual and non-judgmental environment. Our goal is to enable opportunities for adult gymnastics!
