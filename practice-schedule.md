# Practice Schedule
Sundays from 6:30-8:30pm at World Class Suffolk (one practice per week)

# Practice Format
All of our practices are open gym format which means we do not have a coach and the atmosphere is quite relaxed and free-form. At the beginning of each practice, you will check in via the QR code at the front first and pay any drop-in fees. We do intros, stretch and warm up together then you are on your own to work on drills or skills on any apparatus. Many of us are experienced gymnasts and/or coaches though, and we have a great team atmosphere where we are always willing to help each other out with tips and feedback.

We are required to leave the gym how we found it. This means putting any mats or equipment back neatly the way it was left at the beginning of practice. We have a rental agreement with our host facility, World Class, and it is important that are respectful of their space and belongings.

You are required to sign a waiver on your first practice stating that you understand the risks of doing gymnastics and practicing in an open gym environment with no coach and that you will not hold VBAGC accountable for any injuries. Please print and sign [the waiver](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ThH51oK66MFMfpiMsASLXGLkmXcbsNau/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108086916723310005087&rtpof=true&sd=true) and bring it with you to your first practice.

See our [Pay](vbadultgymnasticsclub.github.io/pay) page on how to pay for your first trial as well as recurring practices!
