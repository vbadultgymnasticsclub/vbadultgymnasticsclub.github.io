##Practice Schedule

Hurricane Gymnastics facility has been kind enough to host our team during open gym sessions to accomodate our team practices. Hurricane Gymnastics offers open gyms three times a week, one of which is an adult only (18+) practice. Please see the below practice schedule, update as of Feburary 2023:

Wednesdays
9-11pm
All ages

Fridays
9-11pm
All ages

Sundays
7:30-9:30pm
18+ only

Wednesdays tend to be calmer, and of course Sundays as well. Fridays tend to be busier. Please disregard the fact that Hurricane Gymnastics may say "closed" on Google when searching for hours of operation during these windows. For questions regarding whether we have practices during holidays or other times, please DM us on Instagram to ask, or email us. Team announcements such as closures are made in our team GroupMe chat, but if it is your first time at the gym or you haven't been added to the group yet and you are unsure about practice, just send us a message
