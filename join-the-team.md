# Join The Team
If you would like to join our team, please send us a message via email (vbadultgymnasticsclub@gmail.com) or Instagram ([@vbadultgymnasticsclub](https://www.instagram.com/vbadultgymnasticsclub/)) letting us know so we know to expect a new person and can give you a very warm welcome! Your first practice will be at trial pricing. Please see our [Practice Schedule](https://vbadultgymnasticsclub.github.io/practice-schedule) for more details on practice/cost schedule and location. 

Please join our [GroupMe](https://groupme.com/join_group/87617300/U5zsqMLk). This is our official channel for team announcements and discussions. We will also announce practice closures here.

Please download and sign our [club waiver](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fhEWErK3oaWonR6rvBYBldgo1uKYgEGT/view) and email it to us as vbadultgymnasticsclub@gmail.com. If you must, you may physically print (one page, front and back) and sign and bring it with you to your first practice (but electronic is preferred).
