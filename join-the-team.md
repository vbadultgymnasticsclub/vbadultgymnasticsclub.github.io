# About
Our team is an adult community club that is part of the [National Association of Intercollegiate Gymnastics Clubs (NAIGC)](https://naigc.org/). The motto of NAIGC is "for the love of the sport". This means that we do gymnastics purely for the love of it, regardless of our current skill level, our past skill level,  our gender, our age, etc. NAIGC offers various levels for both men's and women's events, meaning that there's something for everyone. Our goal is to welcome team members who were ex-level 10 gymnasts, as well as team members who may have only dabbled in recreational gymnastics as a kid, and everyone in between. We foster a supportive team environment during practices and offer peer feedback. Many of us were past coaches and so we learn a lot from each other. 

We encourage all gymnasts, young or old, beginner or experienced, and all genders to join us for practice! 

# Practice Schedule
We currently practice twice a week, on Wednesdays and Fridays from 9-11pm at [Hurricane Gymnastics](http://hurricanegymnastics.com/)' open gym session.
