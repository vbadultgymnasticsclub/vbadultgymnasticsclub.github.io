# AUGUST 2024 ANNOUNCEMENT
Due to unforeseen circumstances to our host gym, we have lost our current gym space (see [WAVY news article](https://wavy.com/video/adult-gymnastics-club-looking-for-new-facility-following-suspension-of-open-gym-practices/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR1CVcEupfZTGgeOBbRumO7eN3GKB85Dt0QRpvf1KhqoYOaPdE2wDw5qORk_aem_bv5FodQa_YgChUhxwTo95g)). However, we are still very much still operating as a team and diligently talking with other gyms to secure a new practice space! We are hoping to have a new practice space this Fall. In the meantime, please join our GroupMe chat, which is the official location for announcements and team discussions [here](https://groupme.com/join_group/87617300/U5zsqMLk) and fill out [the membership form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuBSpcej4FysbI1azOCZ01WQgxU7Z7au8ZBd3OZHnkV_C3qw/viewform?usp=sf_link) so that we know you are interested and can count you in once we begin again!

# Join The Team
If you would like to join our team, please send us a message via email or on Instagram stating your interest. Your very first practice will be a free trial. If you are interested in joining our club, you will need to fill out [the membership form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuBSpcej4FysbI1azOCZ01WQgxU7Z7au8ZBd3OZHnkV_C3qw/viewform?usp=sf_link) and pay your $20 annual dues. See our [practice schedule](https://vbadultgymnasticsclub.github.io/practice-schedule) page for date, times, and location. Please bring $10 cash each time to be paid to the Open Gym supervisor for that day, and you will be expected to sign a waiver during your first practice.

The reason we require you to join the team (i.e. pay dues and volunteer just 2 hours per year) is because only team members get access to Sunday practices, and we require a team effort (participating in volunteering to keep our club meets running) and just a little bit of cash to sustain the costs of a team.
