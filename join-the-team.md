# Join The Team
If you would like to join our team, please send us a message via email or on Instagram stating your interest. Your very first practice will be a free trial. If you are interested in joining our club, you will need to fill out [the membership form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuBSpcej4FysbI1azOCZ01WQgxU7Z7au8ZBd3OZHnkV_C3qw/viewform?usp=sf_link) and pay your $20 annual dues. See our [practice schedule](https://vbadultgymnasticsclub.github.io/practice-schedule) page for date, times, and location. Please bring $10 cash each time to be paid to the Open Gym supervisor for that day, and you will be expected to sign a waiver during your first practice.
