# JULY 2024 ANNOUNCEMENT
Due to unforeseen circumstances to our host gym, Hurricane Gymnastics, we are transitioning to a new practice space very soon! Please reach out to us via email to confirm your first practice and make sure you come to the right location! Please also join our GroupMe chat, which is the official location for announcements and team discussions [here](https://groupme.com/join_group/87617300/U5zsqMLk).

# Join The Team
If you would like to join our team, please send us a message via email or on Instagram stating your interest. Your very first practice will be a free trial. If you are interested in joining our club, you will need to fill out [the membership form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuBSpcej4FysbI1azOCZ01WQgxU7Z7au8ZBd3OZHnkV_C3qw/viewform?usp=sf_link) and pay your $20 annual dues. See our [practice schedule](https://vbadultgymnasticsclub.github.io/practice-schedule) page for date, times, and location. Please bring $10 cash each time to be paid to the Open Gym supervisor for that day, and you will be expected to sign a waiver during your first practice.

The reason we require you to join the team (i.e. pay dues and volunteer just 2 hours per year) is because only team members get access to Sunday practices, and we require a team effort (participating in volunteering to keep our club meets running) and just a little bit of cash to sustain the costs of a team.
