# Competitions

We are a proud member of the [NAIGC](https://naigc.org/) (National Association of Intercollegiate Gymnastics Clubs), a national organization that supports club-level gymnastics for adults and college students across the nation. NAIGC offers competition opportunities for adults of all levels. Competition is not required to be part of our cub.

The NAIGC offers competition in Women's Artistic Gymnastics (WAG), Men's Artistic Gymnastics (MAG), Tumbling & Trampoline (T&T), and Decathlon disciplines. See the [competition rules](https://naigc.org/rules/) for more information on leveling and code of points.

Youâ€™ll often find us competing at the local William & Mary Invitational in Williamsburg, NAIGC Nationals, and other events hosted by NAIGC-affiliated colleges throughout Virginia and the Mid-Atlantic region. Please see the [NAIGC list of sanctioned events](https://naigc.org/upcoming-events/) for upcoming meets for this season.

## Competition Leotards
Our competition leotard is available for optional purchase. You are allowed to wear any form-fitting sportswear during NAIGC competitions, as leotards are not required for competition. Our competition leotard is below. We have a team account through GK Elite, please contact us about placing an order for your competition leotard. It takes roughly 4-6 weeks to before it's ready to ship as it is a custom design. The price is ~$250 per leotard.
