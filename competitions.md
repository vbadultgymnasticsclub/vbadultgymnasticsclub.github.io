# Competitions

Currently, the NAIGC offers competition opportunities for adults of all levels. Competition experience is not required to join the club. Competitions are fun and low-key but are not mandatory for team members. The competition season typically goes from January to April each year, with local meets such as William & Mary, NC State, Naval Academy, Virginia Tech, JMU, and farther away meets such as Regionals and Nationals.

Men may choose to compete in JO Level 7, Level 9, or modified NCAA.   Men’s artistic gymnastics (MAG) competition rules can be found [here](https://naigc.org/mens-rules/). Please contact us to get a copy of the MAG code of points, which can be purchased for a small fee.

Women may choose to compete in Xcel Silver, Xcel Platium, JO Level 8, and JO Level 9.  Women’s artistic gymnastics (WAG) competition rules can be found [here](https://naigc.org/womens-rules/). Please contact us to get a copy of the WAG code of points, which can be purchased for a small fee.

The NAIGC allows men to compete women's events and vice versa. This is the Unified Artistic Gymnastics (UAG) discipline (as opposed to WAG or MAG). Some participants may choose to compete Decathlon which is when you compete all 10 MAG and WAG events. It's a lot of fun and many people do it at Nationals. The goal of Unified Artistic Gymnastics (UAG) and Decathlon is to open all events in the sport of gymnastics to any participant regardless of gender or sex. Broadly speaking, under Unified Gymnastics a gymnast may compete in any combination of events from among the ten available Artistic Gymnastics apparatus (WAG: Vault/Uneven Bars/Balance Beam/Floor, MAG: Floor/Pommel Horse/Rings/Vault/Parallel Bars/High Bar). More information on UAG can be found [here](https://naigc.org/uag-rules/).
