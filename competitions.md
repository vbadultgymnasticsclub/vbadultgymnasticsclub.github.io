# Competitions

Currently, the NAIGC offers competition opportunities for adults of all levels. Competition experience is not required to join the club. Competitions are fun and low-key but are not mandatory for team members. The competition season typically goes from January to April each year, with local meets such as William & Mary, NC State, Naval Academy, Virginia Tech, JMU, and farther away meets such as Regionals and Nationals.

Please see the [NAIGC list of sanctioned events](https://naigc.org/upcoming-events/) for upcoming meets for this season. See the [NAIGC rules page](https://naigc.org/rules/) for competition rules for MAG, WAG, and Decathlon.

## Competition Leotards
Our competition leotard is available for optional purchase. You are allowed to wear any form-fitting sportswear during NAIGC competitions, as leotards are not required for competition. However, many competitors do wear leotards and want to look "bedazzled" during competition. Our competition leotard is below. We have a wholesale team account through GK Elite, please contact us about placing an order for your competition leotard. It takes roughly 4-6 weeks to before it's ready to ship as it is custom. The price is a little under $200 per leotard.
