We are a nonprofit community offering open gym-style practices for adults of all ages and experience levels. We meet every Sunday from 6:30–8:30 PM at World Class Gymnastics Too in Suffolk. Whether you’re returning to gymnastics after a break or trying it for the first time, everyone is welcome! There are no tryouts, and there is always capacity for new members.

Our sessions begin with a group warm-up and introductions, followed by open practice where members train independently at their own pace. There is no coach on site, and practices are self-guided and done at your own risk. However, our supportive community often shares advice and encouragement to help each other improve.

Before attending, please [sign our online waiver](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdMvfkJ21OISbY_ON44MipwZDLfCoWonHfgpJlznMz_Gwzkeg/viewform) and pay the [trial fee](https://checkout.square.site/merchant/MLP80EWDW4CD5/checkout/AP6UEU6QKDSXTDMAJH37GEC2) in advance for a smooth check-in. VBAGC operates independently from the gym and carries its own insurance. When you arrive, look for the adult group near the red floor or entrance -- World Class staff may not be able to assist with our practices.
