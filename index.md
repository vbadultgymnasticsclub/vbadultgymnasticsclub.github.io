Virginia Beach Adult Gymnastics Club is an adult gymnastics team for anyone age 18+.   Our goal is to provide opportunities for adults to participate in gymnastics. We are located in Chesapeake, Virginia. There are no try-outs or commitments required! If you are interested in [joining our team](https://vbadultgymnasticsclub.github.io/join-the-team), please contact us to let us know which Sunday you will be coming in so we can keep an eye out for you and give you a warm welcome! Our official team practices are every Sunday. We start by stretching and warming up together, then we break for our open gym format practice. Here is our [Practice Schedule](https://vbadultgymnasticsclub.github.io/practice-schedule). Keep in mind we do not have a formal coach, all practices are open gym format but are all very helpful to one another for giving tips and feedback! The annual team fee is $20 and we require 2 hours of volunteering (helping with meets, planning, etc.). This keeps us up and running as a club! Our co-captains volunteer their time and energy to run the club, so we do require all members, regardless of whether or not they compete, to pay the annual dues, open gym fees, and complete their volunteering.

We encourage a fun, low-pressure, supportive team environment. Competitions are completely optional, but we offer that opportunity to anyone interested.

Our team is an adult community club that is part of the [National Association of Intercollegiate Gymnastics Clubs (NAIGC)](https://naigc.org/). The motto of NAIGC is "for the love of the sport". This means that we do gymnastics purely for the love of it, regardless of our current skill level, our past skill level,  our gender, our age, etc. NAIGC offers various levels for both men's and women's events, meaning that there's something for everyone. Our goal is to welcome team members who were ex-level 10 gymnasts, as well as team members who may have only dabbled in recreational gymnastics as a kid, and everyone in between. We foster a supportive team environment during practices and offer peer feedback. Many of us were past coaches and so we learn a lot from each other. 

We encourage all gymnasts, young or old, beginner or experienced, and all genders to join us for practice! 

Competition opportunities are available for those who are interested.  Members may compete in men’s JO Level 7, 9, and modified NCAA and/or women’s Xcel Silver, Xcel Platium, JO Level 8, and JO Level 9.   Meets are through the National Association of Intercollegiate Gymnastics Clubs ([NAIGC](https://naigc.org)). Please see the [Competitions](https://vbadultgymnasticsclub.github.io/competitions) page for more information.
