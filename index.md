## 🤸‍♀️ About Us
The Virginia Beach Adult Gymnastics Club (VBAGC) is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization and community for adults who love to move, flip, and have fun—whether you're a former gymnast or trying it for the first time! We are the ONLY adult gymnastics team in the Hampton Roads region!

## 🏗️ Founded in 2022 
by a small group of local gymnasts, VBAGC started as a casual meetup and quickly grew into a welcoming space for adults of all ages and backgrounds. We believe gymnastics should be accessible, inclusive, and pressure-free.

## 🎯 Our mission 
is to support adults in staying active, building strength, learning new skills, and connecting with a fun, encouraging community. No tryouts. No coaching. Just self-guided practice and good vibes.

## 🕒 We meet every Sunday
6:30–8:30 PM at [World Class Gymnastics Too](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MApyPnr39rzwTv716) in Suffolk, VA. Group stretch followed by open gym practice, no coach. There is always practice unless cancellation is announced. See [practice schedule](https://vbadultgymnasticsclub.github.io/practice-schedule) to check for cancellations.

## 🙋‍♀️ Just show up
we’re always excited to welcome new members! Don’t be shy. Most of us are adults who’ve been out of the sport for years (or decades) or are new to the sport altogether, and we totally get what it’s like to start again. You’re not alone—we’re all here to have fun and support each other. Here's how to [prep for your first practice with us](https://vbadultgymnasticsclub.github.io/join-the-team).
