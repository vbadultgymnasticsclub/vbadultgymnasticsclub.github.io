Virginia Beach Adult Gymnastics Club is an adult gymnastics team for anyone age 18+.   Our goal is to provide opportunities for adults to participate in gymnastics. We are located in the Hampton Roads area, Virginia. There are no try-outs or commitments required, you just show up to practice! We have many members who come to practice regularly though and we offer optional competitions through the NAIGC. Please see [Practice Schedule](https://vbadultgymnasticsclub.github.io/practice-schedule) to see when you can start coming in!

We encourage a fun, low-pressure, supportive team environment.   All skill levels are welcome!  Practices are up to three times a week, on Wednesdays and Fridays from 9-11pm as well as Sundays from 7:30-9:30pm at Hurricane Gymnastics' open gym session. For more information, please see our [practice schedule](https://vbadultgymnasticsclub.github.io/practice-schedule). If you are interested in joining our team, coming to practices, or competing with us, please send us an email at [vbadultgymnasticsclub@gmail.com](mailto:vbadultgymnasticsclub@gmail.com) and also see our [Join the Team](https://vbadultgymnasticsclub.github.io/join-the-team) page!

Competition opportunities are available for those who are interested.  Members may compete in men’s JO Level 7, 9, and modified NCAA and/or women’s Xcel Silver, Xcel Platium, JO Level 8, and JO Level 9.   Meets are through the National Association of Intercollegiate Gymnastics Clubs ([NAIGC](https://naigc.org)).
