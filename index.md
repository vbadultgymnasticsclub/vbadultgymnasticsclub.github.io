Virginia Beach Adult Gymnastics Club is an adult gymnastics team for anyone age 18+.   Our goal is to provide opportunities for adults to participate in gymnastics. We are located in the Hampton Roads area, Virginia. There are no try-outs or commitments required, you just show up to practice! We have many members who come to practice regularly though and we offer optional competitions through the NAIGC. Please see [Practice Schedule](https://vbadultgymnasticsclub.github.io/practice-schedule) to see when you can start coming in!

We encourage a fun, low-pressure, supportive team environment.   All skill levels are welcome!  Practices are up to three times a week, on Wednesdays and Fridays from 9-11pm as well as Sundays from 7:30-9:30pm at Hurricane Gymnastics' open gym session. For more information, please see our [practice schedule](https://vbadultgymnasticsclub.github.io/practice-schedule). If you are interested in joining our team, coming to practices, or competing with us, please send us an email at [vbadultgymnasticsclub@gmail.com](mailto:vbadultgymnasticsclub@gmail.com) and also see our [Join the Team](https://vbadultgymnasticsclub.github.io/join-the-team) page!

Our team is an adult community club that is part of the [National Association of Intercollegiate Gymnastics Clubs (NAIGC)](https://naigc.org/). The motto of NAIGC is "for the love of the sport". This means that we do gymnastics purely for the love of it, regardless of our current skill level, our past skill level,  our gender, our age, etc. NAIGC offers various levels for both men's and women's events, meaning that there's something for everyone. Our goal is to welcome team members who were ex-level 10 gymnasts, as well as team members who may have only dabbled in recreational gymnastics as a kid, and everyone in between. We foster a supportive team environment during practices and offer peer feedback. Many of us were past coaches and so we learn a lot from each other. 

We encourage all gymnasts, young or old, beginner or experienced, and all genders to join us for practice! 

Competition opportunities are available for those who are interested.  Members may compete in men’s JO Level 7, 9, and modified NCAA and/or women’s Xcel Silver, Xcel Platium, JO Level 8, and JO Level 9.   Meets are through the National Association of Intercollegiate Gymnastics Clubs ([NAIGC](https://naigc.org)). Please see the [Competitions](https://vbadultgymnasticsclub.github.io/competitions) page for more information.
